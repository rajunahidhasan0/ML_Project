# **Project Title**: [ML Project: Human Activity Recognition]

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting outcomes and analyzing data. The project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling, focusing on a given dataset of human activity recognition (HAR) or analysis, collected from multiple users (15 in total) performing various activities.

---

## **Project Structure**
- **`src/`**: Contains all scripts used for data preprocessing and modeling.
- **`data/`**: Holds processed datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **`notebooks/`**: Includes Jupyter notebooks detailing the implementation and results.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts and organizes data from a compressed file (`DataSet.zip`).
2. **Data Parsing**: Utilizes Python libraries like `glob` to parse and structure data into DataFrames for further processing.
3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Identifies and handles missing values.
   - Normalizes and scales data for efficient modeling.
   - Implements exploratory data analysis using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize trends and insights.
